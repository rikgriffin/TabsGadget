Tabs gadget version 0.12 (30 Nov 2011)
© Rik Griffin 2003-15

Note - ResEd 0.52 has built in support for Tabs gadgets. To create a Tabs
gadget in ResEd, just drag from the "Gadgets" window in the same way as you
would for any other gadget type. ResEd is available from

Technical information

A Tabs gadget has 3 properties, although as noted above, ResEd 0.52 has
support built in and you shouldn't need to edit these properties directly,
unless you are creating a gadget in code for example.

The first property is an integer at offset 0, and is the foreground colour
of the gadget, as a Wimp colour. The default is 7 (black).

The second property is an integer at offset 4 and is the background
colour. The default is 1 (standard Wimp background grey).

The third property is a string, whose reference is at offset 8. The
string is a comma separated list. The list items are simply the names of
the window objects to be shown by each tab. The text in the tab itself is
the title string of the window object shown. The window objects are always
shown without a title bar, however you will probably also want to set the
title bar foregound colour to transparent, to get rid of the window
border (unless you need the window to have other furniture, in which
case you have to have the window border).

The gadget's flags word is used, apart fom the 2 standard flags in bits 30
and 31, the flag in bit 0 controls whether scroll arrows are shown if the
tabs are too wide for the gadget's extent.

To see the gadget work, make sure the module is loaded and the load the
supplied resource file into !ResTest. However note that for some reason
ResTest sometimes crashes when the Tabs object delivers an event - I think
this is a fault in ResTest but I'm not sure yet.

Feedback is welcomed, please send to rik.grf@gmail.com


Version history
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Version 0.12: Updated C veneers to support Tabs_HideTab.

Version 0.11: Fixed data aborts when creating / deleting a gadget with no
nested windows.

Version 0.10: Recompiled to hopefully be Beagleboard compatible. Fixed
redraw problems when gadget shown in ResEd.

Version 0.09: the Tabs' background now shows a window texture, if one is
selected.

Version 0.06: Updated so it should work with both the RISC OS Ltd version
and the Iyonix (RISC OS 5) version of the Toolbox.


Methods
~~~~~~~

Note - for C programmers there is a supplied library "TabsLib" which
provides veneers for these methods. See Tabs.h for details. The file
Veneers.c is also supplied in case you need to recompile them. As
supplied they are compiled as 32 bit code.


Tabs_SetState 0x402c 16428
entry:
r0 = flags
r1 = window
r2 = 0x402c
r3 = component id
r4 = new gadget flags

exit:
none

Use this instead of Gadget_SetFlags.



Tabs_GetState 0x402d 16429
entry:
r0 = flags
r1 = window
r2 = 0x402d
r3 = component id

exit:
r0 = gadget flags

Use this instead of Gadget_GetFlags.



Tabs_SetSelected 0x402e 16430
entry:
r0 = flags
r1 = window
r2 = 0x402e
r3 = component id
r4 = index of tab to select (starts at 0)

exit:
r0 = previously selected tab index

Equivalent to clicking on the specified tab. Returns an error if the
supplied tab index is invalid.



Tabs_GetSelected 0x402f 16431
entry:
r0 = flags
r1 = window
r2 = 0x402f
r3 = component id

exit:
r0 = currently selected tab index


Tabs_TabFromWindow 0x4030 16432
entry:
r0 = flags
r1 = window
r2 = 0x4030
r3 = component id
r4 = window object id

exit:
r0 = tab index

Returns the index of the tab which has a particular window associated
with it. Note that if you use shared window objects, only the first tab
to use a particular window will be returned. Returns -1 if the supplied
window object id doesn't match any attached to tabs.


Tabs_WindowFromTab 0x4031 16433
r0 = flags
r1 = window
r2 = 0x4031
r3 = component id
r4 = tab index

exit:
r0 = window object id

Returns the window object that a particular tab is associated with.
Returns an error if the supplied tab index is invalid.


Tabs_SetLabel 0x4032 16434
r0 = flags
r1 = window
r2 = 0x4032
r3 = component id
r4 = tab index
r5 = pointer to new label text

exit:
none

Sets the text for a particular tab. By default the text is the title of
the window nested in the tab, but it can be changed with this method.
Returns an error if the supplied tab index is invalid.


Tabs_GetLabel 0x4033 16435
r0 = flags
r1 = window
r2 = 0x4033
r3 = component id
r4 = tab index
r5 = ptr to buffer or 0 to find size
r6 = size of buffer (if r5 != 0)

exit:
if r5 = 0 on entry:
  r6 = size of buffer required

if r5 != 0 on entry:
  r6 = number of bytes written to buffer


Tabs_HideTab 0x4034 16436
r0 = flags
r1 = window
r2 = 0x4034
r3 = component id
r4 = tab index
r5 = 1 to hide, 0 to show

exit:
all preserved

Hides or shows a particular tab, depending on the flag in r5.
